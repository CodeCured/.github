# Code Cured The Cat

## What is CCTC?

Code Cured The Cat is a project to create a new kind of charity: one that is digital-first.

Whilst most charities want your *time* or your *money*, CCTC wants your *expertise*. Collaboratively create software (or ideas) to raise money to improve cat's lives, no matter where you are or what you do for a living.
