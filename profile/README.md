# Code Cured The Cat

## What is CCTC?

Code Cured The Cat is a project to create a new kind of charity: one that is digital-first.

Whilst most charities want your *time* or your *money*, CCTC wants your *expertise*. Collaboratively create software that helps raise money to improve cat's lives, no matter where you are or what you do.

## Principles

1. **100% of raised money goes to cats**. No legal funds, no investments, no hosting costs, no rent, no wages, just improving cat's lives. Day to day expenses will be paid by trustees.
2. **100% of transactions are public ASAP**. All income, all outgoings, all public. Whilst some details (e.g. donator name) might need to be removed, the amount and approximate source / destination should be visible publicly (ideally immediately).
3. **100% of tools / process are open-source**. No paywalls, no mysterious income sources, full visibility at all times.

## How is money raised?

By creating software!

For example, an easy way to fundraise via Twitch, donation-funded open source utilities, affiliate links, etc.

## How is money spent?

Every penny is spent on improving the life of cat(s). 

Initially the most direct way will be purchasing items for specific cat rescue centres, but this might not be scalable!
