[Code Cured The Cat](https://codecured.org) is a project to create a new kind of charity: one that is digital-first.

Whilst most charities want your *time* or your *money*, Code Cured wants your *expertise* and *creativity*. Collaboratively create software (or ideas) to raise money to improve cat's lives, no matter where you are or what you do for a living.
